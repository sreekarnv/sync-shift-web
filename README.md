# Timing Consensus Scheduler (Web)

<br />

## Problem Statement

Assume that you are required to develop a scheduler application for BITS community members
(student and staff) based on their availability. Members can register as staff/ student roles using
their BITS email ID. The application will have a sign-in page, from where members can register.
Registered members can log in via login page with BITS email and password set during
registration. After logging into the application members can look for the availability of other
community members and facilities. Members can also set their availability.
